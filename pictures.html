Our team and paddlers from other teams participated in boot camp in May 2011 in Wallceburg.  We relearned some information and learned some new things.  Don't we look enthusiastic? <br>
Coaches Aron Nash and Braden de Groot taught us safety and which techniques get the best results from the boat and paddle stroke.<p></p>

                                          <b>My Greatest Adventure</b><p>

<div align="left">On February 23, 2006 twenty-seven determined people, some breast cancer
survivors were driven from our hotel in Moshi, Tanzania, to the park gate
and started our climb to Mt. Kilimanjaro, to raise funds for the Canadian
Breast Cancer Foundation.  Through hot sun, rain, hail and snow, hiking over
large boulders on the edges of cliffs, we reached the summit, 5895metres,
after eight days, on March second.  After over an hour of rejoicing and much
picture taking in clouds and snow we started our descent to our overnight
camp.  On Friday March third, we hiked for over five hours down steep grades
and more boulders and loose gravel and reached the park gate where we were
transported back to our hotel in land cruisers.This was truly an
eye-opening, wonderful experience of a lifetime which I shall never forget.<p>
